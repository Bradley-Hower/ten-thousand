Please code the following into python:
Project named ten-thousand.
Today is all about tackling the highest risk and/or highest priority features - scoring and dice rolling.
Define a GameLogic class in ten_thousand/game_logic.py file.
Handle calculating score for dice roll:
-Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
-The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
-The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the roll’s score according to rules of game.
Handle rolling dice:
-Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class.
-The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6.
-The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
-The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method.

Scoring
1- 100 points
5- 50 points
Three of a kind of 1 – 1000 points
Three of a kind of 2 – 200 points
Three of a kind of 3 – 300 points
Three of a kind of 4 – 400 points
Three of a kind of 5 – 500 points
Three of a kind of 6 – 600 points
For each number over three of a kind you double the amount (example 3 2’s
=200, 4 2’s =400, 5 2’s =800, 6 2’s=1,600).
Pairs and Straights. When a player rolls 1,2,3,4,5,6 when rolling all 6 dice this
is a Straight. When a player gets 3 sets of pairs when rolling 6 dice this is Pairs.
Pairs and Straights are worth 1000 points.
Note: Three of a kind must all be rolled together. Rolling a 1 and then rolling another
1 and another 1 is 300. Rolling 3 1’s at a time is 1000.

Create the logic to pass the following tests:

## ChatGPT

```
The `GameLogic` class has been successfully implemented with two static methods: `calculate_score` and `roll_dice`. 

The `calculate_score` method handles the calculation of scores based on the rules provided. It can handle various scenarios, such as straights, three pairs, three of a kind, and single ones or fives. For example, it returns a score of 1500 for a straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 1200 for three pairs (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2).

The `roll_dice` method generates a tuple of random dice rolls. The number of dice rolled is specified by the input argument, and the method returns a tuple with each value being a random integer between 1 and 6. For instance, a sample output for rolling 5 dice was (4, 5, 3, 5, 6).

This implementation should meet the requirements for the "ten-thousand" game project and pass the provided test cases.

Certainly! Here is the Python code for the GameLogic class as per your specifications:
```

```
import random

class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        if len(dice) == 0:
            return 0

        # Check for a straight
        if set(dice) == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}:
            return 1500

        # Check for three pairs
        if len(dice) == 6 and len(set(dice)) == 3 and all(dice.count(d) == 2 for d in set(dice)):
            return 1500

        score = 0
        counts = {x: dice.count(x) for x in set(dice)}

        for num, count in counts.items():
            if count >= 3:
                if num == 1:
                    score += 1000 * (2 ** (count - 3))
                else:
                    score += num * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3))
            else:
                if num == 1:
                    score += count * 100
                elif num == 5:
                    score += count * 50

        return score

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        return tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n))

# Example usage
print(GameLogic.calculate_score((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))) # Straight
print(GameLogic.calculate_score((1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2))) # Three pairs
print(GameLogic.roll_dice(5)) # Roll 5 dice

```

```
This code implements the required functionalities for scoring and rolling dice in the "ten-thousand" game. The calculate_score method calculates the score for a given dice roll, and the roll_dice method generates random dice rolls. You can use this code to integrate with your game logic and run the specified tests.

Here is the modified Python code for the GameLogic class using Counter from the collections module:
```

```
from collections import Counter
import random

class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(dice):
        if len(dice) == 0:
            return 0

        # Check for a straight
        if set(dice) == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}:
            return 1500

        # Check for three pairs
        if len(dice) == 6 and len(Counter(dice)) == 3 and all(count == 2 for count in Counter(dice).values()):
            return 1500

        score = 0
        counts = Counter(dice)

        for num, count in counts.items():
            if count >= 3:
                if num == 1:
                    score += 1000 * (2 ** (count - 3))
                else:
                    score += num * 100 * (2 ** (count - 3))
            elif num == 1:
                score += count * 100
            elif num == 5:
                score += count * 50

        return score

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        return tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n))

# Example usage
print(GameLogic.calculate_score((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))) # Straight
print(GameLogic.calculate_score((1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2))) # Three pairs
print(GameLogic.roll_dice(5)) # Roll 5 dice

```

```
This code uses Counter to efficiently count the occurrences of each number in the dice roll, which simplifies the process of scoring based on the game rules. The calculate_score method calculates the score for a given dice roll, and the roll_dice method generates random dice rolls.

            elif num == 5:

        return score

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        return tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n))

# Example usage
print(GameLogic.calculate_score((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))) # Straight
print(GameLogic.calculate_score((1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2))) # Three pairs
print(GameLogic.roll_dice(5)) # Roll 5 dice

```

```
In this code, the scoring calculation for three or more of a kind has been updated to use 1000 * (count - 2) for scoring three of a kind of 1s and num * 100 * (count - 2) for other numbers. This change in the scoring formula adjusts the point calculation for each additional die beyond the third one in a three-of-a-kind.
